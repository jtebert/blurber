# Blurber: a web app for book blurbs.

[Try it here](http://blurber.herokuapp.com/)

People never seem to find time to read books anymore, or even read the blurbs on the book covers. We've created a solution by creating new book blurbs for all kinds of book genres. Select a genre to generate a random blurb, or take your chances with a blurb from everything under the sun (or everything on Amazon). If you find a one you like, you can create a permalink to share it or save it forever.

Built on the Amazon Product Advertising API and created with Markov Chains, you can now read about books that don't exist, so you don't have to feel guilty about not reading any more than the title and the first half of the blurb.

*Coming Soon: An API. We hope. Put your blurbs anywhere!*
