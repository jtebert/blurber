    <p>Have you ever wanted to read about a book that doesn't exist? Or maybe you just think book descriptions are too logical.</p>
    <p>Here's a tool perfectly suited to your eccentricity! Just pick a genre and you'll receive a probably-but-not-guaranteed-to-be unique book blurb, built on descriptions of real, live, <i>actual</i> books. If you're feeling particularly ambitious, for extra credit you can go ahead and write the book you get a blurb for.</p>

    <a href="{% url 'blurb:genre_blurb' 'random' %}" class="big-button-link">Random Blurb</a>

    <h1 class="centered">Pick a genre:</h1>
    <div class="tile-box">
    {% for genre in genres %}

            <span>{{ genre.name }}</span>
